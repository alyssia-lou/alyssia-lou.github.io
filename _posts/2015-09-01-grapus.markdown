description: >
  Poorly documented, the socially engaged collective of graphic artists Grapus (1970-1990) is often unknown to current generations. Grapus doesnâ€™t have any recognition on the web. So I made their website and created their Instagram and Twitter profile, and also their Facebook fanpage. The website has been taken down, at the request of Grapus members.
