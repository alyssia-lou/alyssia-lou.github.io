description: >
  *De mémoire (By Memory)* is my master's thesis dealing about the missing picture, a recurrent issue in the long history of migrations. The missing picture also raises the question of fiction and how memory can be subject to changes. There are no images in this book, calling the reader's imagination to depict himself the missing pictures. Unfolded, the cover becomes a poster with all the pictures.
