description: >
  Inspired by my family's history, this thesis deals about the missing picture, a recurrent issue in the long history of migrations. The missing picture also raises the question of fiction and how memory can be subject to changes. The call upon our memory seems to be modified by the mutations that affect our perception through time. There are no images in this book, calling the reader's imagination to depict himself the missing pictures. Unfolded, the cover becomes a poster with all the pictures.
